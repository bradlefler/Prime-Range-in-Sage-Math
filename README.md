# Prime-Range-in-Sage-Math

#### This function was made using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all of the prime numbers between two given integers. This is meant for large integers, so the output does not include every prime found. Instead, it prints out the number of prime numbers found, the first ten prime numbers found, and the last ten prime numbers found.
